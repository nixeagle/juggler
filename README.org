In progress lisp implementation of juggler on meatfighter

* Setup
  We depend on the following git repositories:

  : git://github.com/nixeagle/Eos.git
  : git://github.com/nixeagle/nutils.git

  Please clone those and symlink them.

  Next use =asdf-install= to install =alexandria= and =cl-gd= if they are
  not already setup. =cl-gd= requires a bit of extra setup, after you
  install it vie asdf do the following to finalize the installation[fn:1]:

  : cd ~/.sbcl/site/cl-gd-0.5.7
  : gcc -fPIC -c cl-gd-glue.c
  : ld -lgd -lz -lpng -ljpeg -lfreetype -lm -shared cl-gd-glue.o -o cl-gd-glue.so
  : rm cl-gd-glue.o


* Footnotes

[fn:1] Assuming sbcl is used here, please change depending on what lisp
you are using.
